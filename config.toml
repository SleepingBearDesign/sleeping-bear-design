		description = "Sleeping Bear Design is ran and operated by <a href='https://brodyberson.com' target='_blank'>Brody Berson</a> from West Michigan, right on the shores of Lake Michigan. His passion for what he does started with a belief in the West Michigan area and its locals, and it has since grown into something much bigger. He is working to help bring small businesses, startups, and other young professionals to the forefront of the public's attention with a strong presence on the web. Sleeping Bear Design serves as a direct portfolio of all of his web development work. I specialize in static digital marketing websites with social media tie-ins, blogs, and small e-commerce storefronts."
